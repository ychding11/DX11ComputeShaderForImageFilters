Info
====

This project implements an simple image filter which is based on DX11 Computer
Shader. It takes advantage of parallel of modern GPU. You may regard it as
tiny framework and write your own image filters based on DX11 compute shader.
Have fun and try it yourself.

Source
======

The source code is ported from an [compute shader tutorial](http://www.codinglabs.net/tutorial_compute_shaders_filters.aspx).
For details about compute shader and how it works, please read the tutorial.
The original code contains the deprecated DXSDK APIs, so it always compiles
failed on Windows 10 platform. What I did here is to replace the deprecated
APIs with new ones.

Problems
========
1. adjust window size according to input image.
2. thread group dimension  is hard-code now.
3. big image issue.

Controls
========

F1     : 
F2     :
